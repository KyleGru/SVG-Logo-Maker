  ## Description
  This project helps developers quickly create a simple SVG (Scalable Vector Graphics) logo for their projects.

  Typically a logo created by a graphic designer can be very expensive. This application provides developers the capability to create their own simple logo quickly and efficiantly. 

  Here is a link to the use of this application 

  ## Screenshots
  Example logos:

  ## What I Learned
  Creating this application, I learned how to use OOP (Object Oriented Programming) to make the code easier to understand. I also utilized the Jest test suite to test that the code was returning the correct shape and color. This was the first time that I have used unit testing within an application I built.

  ## Installation
  To install this application go to the link to the repository below. From there click the green code button and copy the SSH key to clone the repo. From there you can copy those files into a directory of your choice in your terminal. Open the file in whatever editor you like to use and then open the terminal in that editor to make sure you"re in the correct directory. You will need to run the "npm init -y" command in the terminal to create a package.json. Next you need to install inquirer by typing "npm i inquirer@8.2.4" in the terminal and lastly install jest by typing "npm i jest" in the terminal. Now you are able to run the application by typing "node index.js" and you will be presented with prompts to create your logo.

  ## Tests
  Open the file in your preferred code editor and open the terminal command line, make sure you're in the root folder directory for the application, and type "npm run test" in the terminal command line. Now the program will run a test using jest to make sure that the three tests in the shapes.test.js file are all returning a string confirming that the shape and color are correct.
